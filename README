KSx::Analysis::StripAccents, version 0.04 (beta)

This module provides a drop-in replacement for 
KinoSearch::Analysis::LCNormalizer. In addition to folding text to
lowercase, it strips accents (if you haven’t already guessed).

This is identical to version 0.01 except for the Makefile.PL
and tests.


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Letters that have more than one lowercase form, but one capital form
(such as sigma), are now normalised properly.
