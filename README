KSx::Analysis::StripAccents, version 0.05 (beta)

This module provides a drop-in replacement for 
KinoSearch::Analysis::LCNormalizer. In addition to folding text to
lowercase, it strips accents (if you haven’t already guessed).


CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Modified to work with the latest devel revision (4551) of KinoSearch
(while still maintaining backward compatibility)
