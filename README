KSx::Analysis::StripAccents, version 0.03 (beta)

This module provides a drop-in replacement for 
KinoSearch::Analysis::LCNormalizer. In addition to folding text to
lowercase, it strips accents (if you haven’t already guessed).

This is identical to version 0.01 except for the Makefile.PL
and tests.
